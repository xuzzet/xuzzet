Hey, I’m André!
Frontend developer in the making, focused on building sleek and interactive web experiences.
I’m on a mission to master every tool and language that powers the modern web—no limits, just growth.

I might be new to the coding scene, but I’m leveling up fast and always pushing myself to create something cooler than yesterday.
